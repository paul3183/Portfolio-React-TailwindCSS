        <p>I like to undertake, I adore challenges and I don't give up easily. Very detailed and self-taught every day, I never stop learning and I have a special gift for people.</p>
        <p>After years of experience, I have made the decision to redirect my professional career with the aim of continuing to learn and also contribute all my acquired experience. I believe that change is a sign of the ability to improve and, therefore, I believe that I would always be capable of adding value to the company in which I find myself. My main objective is to develop professionally and evolve in my sector, so I look for opportunities that allow me to do so, while trying to fully align with the goals of the company.</p>
